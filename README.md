<h1>Global Sales Logistics KPI Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on developing a critical Global Sales and Logistics KPI Dashboard using the advanced Business Intelligence features within Microsoft Excel (Power Query and Power Pivot). The objective was to provide the management team of a global electronics retailer with a dynamic tool to track core performance metrics.

Methodology: Despite the limitation to raw CSV files (sales, stores, products, customers), I implemented a robust BI process entirely within Excel:

Data Connection and Transformation (Power Query): Imported the folder of raw CSV data and used Power Query (M Language) to clean, merge, and transform the data, handling dirty entries and normalizing fields.
Relational Data Modeling (Power Pivot): Built a scalable Star Schema data model in Power Pivot, defining the relationships between the various dimension and fact tables, which optimized data analysis speed.
KPI Calculation (DAX): Created sophisticated calculated columns and DAX measures to define the required KPIs, including Total Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and the crucial Average Delivery Time.
Interactive Dashboard Design: Designed a professional, interactive dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers, enabling management to filter data by store, product, and time period for granular sales and logistics monitoring.
Impact: The final dashboard empowered the client to move beyond static spreadsheets, gaining immediate, centralized visibility into critical Sales & Logistics performance, thereby enabling faster decision-making to optimize the supply chain and revenue streams.
