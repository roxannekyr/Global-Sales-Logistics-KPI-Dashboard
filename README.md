<h1>Global Sales Logistics KPI Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on leveraging MySQL to perform comprehensive business analysis on the Maven Movies dataset, directly addressing a strategic decision—the potential sale of the business.

Methodology: I used advanced SQL querying skills to extract, join, and analyze data across multiple tables (e.g., rentals, films, customers, inventory) to answer specific questions posed by a potential restaurant/bar owner acquirer. The analysis was designed to provide a deep, data-driven understanding of the rental business, including:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Identifying top-performing films, busiest rental periods, and inventory utilization.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzing customer lifetime value and rental behavior patterns.
Operational Insights: Determining optimal store locations, staff performance, and inventory needs.
Impact: The detailed, data-backed answers provided critical support for the valuation and due diligence process. The analysis successfully translated complex database information into clear, actionable business insights, enabling an informed decision regarding the potential acquisition.

Tools: MySQL Workbench, SQL (SELECT, JOIN, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries).
